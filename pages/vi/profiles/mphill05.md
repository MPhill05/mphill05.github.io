## Who I am

I am currently a freelance **iOS developer** as well as a **Web Developer** primarily using *Angular 5* and learning to expand on my
skills with the **MEAN stack**. I write iOS software natively in **Swift** and learned coding with Java in college.

## Outside of coding

Outside of writing software, I spend a lot of time writing music with **Ableton Live** and have been producing/DJing for roughly 7 years.
I am self taught in regards of web development, as all my formal experience has been with backend development.
In my free time I'm either at the *gym* or *traveling* to *snowboard*.

### Where to find me

You can see some of my existing work on my [Portfolio][1] and previous coding samples on my [Github][2].
